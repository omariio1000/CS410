1) One thing that makes this code hard to maintain is that it's impossible to add more rooms, as it's very limited what types of rooms you can leave or enter. I suggest that changes to allow any string, to allow more rooms to be added easily.

2) There are almost no comments, which makes it difficult to understand what's happening for a lot of people. I personally prefer fewer comments, so I will be doing that.

Those two simple yet important changes take the program from being very difficult to maintain to being very easy to add more to and understand if newly joining a team.
