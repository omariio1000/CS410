1) The tabs aren't large enough, 4 spaces or just a tab character would make it more readable than 2 spaces
	- This is my personal choice, come from heavy c/c++ background
2) Room names are not very easy to understand; A, B, and C are pretty arbitrary
3) Lots of text wider than the screen
4) Not very consistent checking if have key or not have key

The rest looks pretty good to me. I've had quite a bit of previous experience working with a lot of code written by other people that makes me fine with a lot of different styles. I'm pretty adaptable and can understand the gist of what the code is doing pretty easily
