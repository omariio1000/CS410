The way I would go about this is by adding a prompt asking for langugae. For each language there would be an option, and there would be a variable in order to select the language. Every time there's a prompt or console statement, I would have an if-else-if statement or a switch case in order to print in a certain language. The default case would just be the existing English statement. This way, I won't have to change any existing code, just add new code.
